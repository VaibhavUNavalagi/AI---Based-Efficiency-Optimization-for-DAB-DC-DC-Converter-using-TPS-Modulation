## Overview
This project leverages **Q-Learning**, a reinforcement learning technique, to optimize the efficiency of a **Dual Active Bridge (DAB) DC-DC Converter** using **Triple Phase Shift (TPS) modulation**. The approach focuses on improving power control while reducing losses and enhancing system stability.

- Achieved **99.6%** power tracking accuracy.
- Reduced RMS current by **15.2%**.
- Ensured robust converter performance under varying load conditions.

## Features
- Reinforcement learning-based control for DAB converter.
- Adaptive TPS modulation for efficiency optimization.
- Real-time simulation and performance monitoring.
